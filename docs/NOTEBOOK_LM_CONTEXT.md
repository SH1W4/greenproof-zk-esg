# 🧠 GreenProof: Executive Context for NotebookLM
**Subject**: The Sovereign Threshold Attestation Protocol for Institutional RWAs
**Developer**: NEO-SH1W4 (Symbeon Labs)
**Standard**: Chainlink Convergence 2026

## 1. Project Essence (The TL;DR)
GreenProof solves the **ESG Oracle Problem** in the $2.1T Green Bond market. It transforms static, self-reported, and easily manipulated ESG claims into **Sovereign Evidence**. 

- **Core Innovation**: A decentralized orchestration layer (Chainlink CRE) that synchronizes Physical (IoT), Juridical (Legal), and Ethical (Governance) data streams.
- **Privacy Engine**: ZK-SNARKs (Circom) ensure that sensitive industrial telemetry is proven (`score >= 80`) without being exposed publically.
- **Portability**: Credits are minted as NFTs on Sepolia and bridged globally via Chainlink CCIP to Avalanche Fuji.

## 2. Technical Pillars (Hierarchy of Truth)
The system operates as a **Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (HAAS)**:
- **GP-Physical**: Ingests real-world telemetry (Carbon sensors, energy grids).
- **GP-Juridical**: Validates claims against regulatory benchmarks (ISO-14030).
- **GP-Ethical**: Ensures alignment with global ESG mandates.

**Consensus Rule**: A 2/3 threshold is required across the Trinity before a ZK proof is triggered. This makes the protocol "Greenwashing-Proof".

## 3. Tooling & SDK Implementation
- **Chainlink CRE**: Programmable master orchestrator (`cre/greenproof-orchestrator.ts`).
- **Chainlink Functions**: Data ingestion from decentralized publishers.
- **Chainlink CCIP**: Native cross-chain asset movement.
- **Circom/snarkjs**: ZK-SNARK circuit for the "ESG Membrane".

## 4. Strategic Positioning
GreenProof is not just an app; it's a **Generic Primitive**. While ESG is the first use case (High Impact Hackathon Track), the "Sovereign MAS" can prove any threshold-based reality (Supply Chain, Credit Worthiness, IP Integrity).
