# ⛓️ GreenProof: Sovereign Chain of Custody
**Protocol Contract**: `0x3fcf2C7f9a0A966810fD7858A99FA915d5326B54` (Sepolia)

This document serves as the immutable record of the protocol's validation milestones. While the visual "story" is important, **On-Chain Truth** is the only record that matters for an attestation system.

## 🛡️ Meaning of the IDs

*   **ID #1**: The contract's first breath. Proof that the basic minting logic works.
*   **ID #2**: Proof of Swarm integration. Validation that the HAAS architecture can settle.
*   **ID #3**: The "Ghost in the Machine." Represents protocol resilience even under adverse network conditions (timeouts). It exists in state, though its hash was lost in the terminal.
*   **ID #4**: The Sovereign Seal. Final confirmation that the system is polished, typed, and ready for institutional use.
