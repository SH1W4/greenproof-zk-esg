# 📐 The Conceptual Foundation of GreenProof (GP-MAS)

GreenProof is built on a formal multi-agent consensus system designed to verify **Objective Reality** through computational trust and cryptographic privacy.

## 1. The Trinity of Proof
The core of the protocol is the **Consensus Layer**, where three specialized agents collaborate to validate a Real World Asset (RWA):
- **GP-Physical**: Real-time telemetry and IoT signals.
- **GP-Juridical**: Regulatory and legal compliance.
- **GP-Ethical**: Social impact and value alignment.

A **2/3 Quorum** is strictly required to reach a protocol-level consensus, ensuring that no single point of failure can compromise the integrity of the ESG claim.

## 2. Privacy via ZK-SNARKs
GreenProof utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to transform sensitive and private industrial data into a binary "Compliance Attestation".
- **Zero Exposure**: Raw sensor data and proprietary legal details remain private.
- **Verifiable Truth**: The blockchain only records a cryptographic proof that the asset has met the defined threshold (e.g., Score >= 80).

## 3. Sovereign Infrastructure
By leveraging **Chainlink CRE** for orchestration and **CCIP** for global portability, GreenProof ensures that trust is not just a claim, but a programmable and portable asset.
