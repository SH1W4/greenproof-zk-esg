# Juridical Seal — GreenProof

This document records the legal/compliance framing used in GreenProof demonstrations for evaluators.

## Scope
- **Protocol objective**: prove ESG threshold compliance (`score >= 80`) with privacy preservation.
- **Method**: Triple-oracle consensus (Physical + Juridical + Ethical) followed by ZK threshold proof.
- **Settlement**: On-chain credential issuance and cross-chain portability narrative via Chainlink stack.

## What the seal means in this repository
The "Juridical Seal" badge indicates that the demo flow includes:
1. explicit legal/compliance validation stage in the architecture narrative;
2. auditable public references for demo deployment and transaction proof;
3. evaluator-facing documentation for reproducibility.

## Limitations
- This repository is a **hackathon prototype**, not a legal opinion.
- Any production legal enforceability requires jurisdiction-specific counsel and formal policy controls.

## Pointers for judges
- High-level narrative: `README.md`
- Judge-oriented summary: `docs/JUDGES_README.md`
- Architecture deep dive: `docs/HAAS_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Mathematical framing: `docs/MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATION.md`
