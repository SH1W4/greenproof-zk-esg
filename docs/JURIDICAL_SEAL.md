# ⚖️ GreenProof Juridical Seal (Th3m1s Validated)

**Status**: SEALED  
**Validator**: Th3m1s (Symbeon Legal Node)  
**Standard**: ISO-14030 (Green Bonds) & ICMA Principles

This seal attests that the **GreenProof** architecture has undergone an algorithmic juridical audit to ensure the validity of its attestations across both Common Law and Civil Law jurisdictions.

## 🛡️ Validation Criteria (The 3 Pillars)

### 1. 🔍 Evidence Admissibility
The use of **Chainlink CRE** ensures the data's chain of custody.
- **Mitigated Risk**: "Oracle Manipulation Risk"
- **Solution**: Trinity Consensus (2/3) prevents a single point of failure from corrupting the evidence.

### 2. 🔐 Industrial Privacy (Trade Secret Protection)
The use of **ZK-SNARKs (Circom)** ensures that trade secrets (raw telemetry) are not publicly exposed.
- **Mitigated Risk**: "Information Leakage"
- **Solution**: The `ESGScore.circom` circuit proves only threshold compliance (`score >= 80`), keeping input data private (Private Witness).

### 3. 🌐 Jurisdictional Neutrality (Sovereignty)
The protocol is agnostic to physical jurisdiction.
- **Mitigated Risk**: "Cross-Border Regulatory Friction"
- **Solution**: Settlement occurs on a decentralized consensus layer (Ethereum Sepolia / Avalanche Fuji), making the certificate a globally portable asset via CCIP.
