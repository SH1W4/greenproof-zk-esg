# Why GreenProof Wins Tokenization/RWA

## 🎯 The Problem
The $2.1 Trillion green bond market is currently plagued by **Greenwashing** and expensive, non-verifiable audit processes. Companies often face a dilemma between transparency (revealing sensitive operational data) and compliance.

## 🔗 The Chainlink Solution
GreenProof is a production-ready infrastructure built on the latest Chainlink stack:
- **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE):** The execution backbone coordinating data, ZK, and cross-chain actions via programmatic workflows (`cre/workflow.ts`).
- **Chainlink CCIP:** Ensures Global RWA portability, allowing ESG NFTs to move across chains seamlessly.
- **Chainlink Functions:** Bridges the gap between unstructured reports and verifiable on-chain metrics.
