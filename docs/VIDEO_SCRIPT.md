# GreenProof: Video Pitch Script (3 Minutes)

## 00:00 - 00:30 | The Hook & Problem
- **Visual:** Stock footage of a factory with "Sustainable" label / Greenwashing news headlines.
- **Narrative:** "ESG is the world's most trusted label with the least amount of trust. Greenwashing and data privacy leaks are killing the green bond market. How do you prove you're sustainable without exposing your secrets?"

## 00:30 - 01:00 | The Tagline & ZK Privacy
- **Visual:** GreenProof Logo + Dashboard intro.
- **Narrative:** "Introducing GreenProof. We don't prove the score; we prove the standard. Using ZK-Proofs, we verify that a company meets an 80% ESG threshold while keeping their raw operational data 100% private."

## 01:00 - 02:00 | Live Demo: The Chainlink Backbone
- **Visual:** Dashboard screen recording.
- **01:00-01:15:** "Clicking 'Start Verification' triggers the Chainlink CRE orchestration."
- **01:15-01:30:** "Watch the Triple Oracle Consensus: IoT sensors, LLM analysis, and Audits agree on a score."
- **01:30-01:45:** "The ZK Proof is generated off-chain. No score is revealed, just a cryptographic checkmark."
- **01:45-02:00:** "The NFT is minted on Sepolia. It's a verifiable, permanent record of compliance."

## 02:00 - 02:30 | CCIP & RWA Infinity

- **Narrative:** "Sustainability is global, and so is GreenProof. Powered by Chainlink CCIP, our ESG NFTs are portable RWAs that can be bridged to any chain for secondary market trading or green bond collateral."

## 02:30 - 03:00 | Call to Action
