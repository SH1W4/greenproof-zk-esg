### [00:00 - 00:15] The Hook
**Visual:** Close-up of "Greenwashing" news headlines. Slow zoom out to a murky, non-transparent chart.
**Audio (Narrator):** ESG is the backbone of the new global economy. But today, investors face two massive hurdles: Greenwashing and Data Privacy. How can a company prove it's sustainable without leaking trade secrets?

### [00:15 - 00:30] The Solution
**Visual:** Transition to GREENPROOF Logo. Sleek, green, and professional.
**Audio (Narrator):** Introducing GreenProof. The first anti-greenwashing protocol powered by Chainlink CRE and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. We don't ask you to trust a PDF. We ask you to trust the math.

### [00:30 - 01:00] The Tech Stack (Demo)
**Visual:** Screen recording of the Dashboard. Click "Start Verification". Watch the 3 Orbs (IoT, LLM, Audit) spin and turn Green.
**Audio (Narrator):** Our workflow starts with Triple Oracle Consensus. Chainlink CRE orchestrates data from IoT sensors, LLM scorers, and third-party auditors. Then, an off-chain ZK-circuit proves the score is ≥ 80% without revealing the raw data points.

### [01:00 - 01:15] Cross-Chain & Minting
**Visual:** NFT Minting pop-up on Sepolia. Then, a button click: "Bridge to Fuji". Show CCIP message progress.
**Audio (Narrator):** Once verified, a GreenProof NFT is minted on Sepolia. And with one click, it's bridged across the fragmented Web3 ecosystem via Chainlink CCIP. Portable, private, and verifiable credentials.

### [01:15 - 01:30] The Impact
**Visual:** Beautiful drone shots of nature / sustainable cities. Final Headline: "Prove ESG ≥ 80%. Bridge it to any chain in 1 click."
**Audio (Narrator):** GreenProof is the infrastructure for the next generation of Green Bonds and Carbon Markets. Join us in making sustainability verifiable. GreenProof: Anti-greenwashing by design.
