# 🔐 GreenProof Knowledge Vault Skill

## 1. Skill Purpose
This skill manages the **Knowledge Vault** (`../greenproof-vault/` or `_vault/`), a proprietary repository of strategic, technical, and business intelligence. It ensures sensitive core logic remains protected while providing a structured way to enrich it for AI analysis.

## 2. Core Directives
- **Zero-Visibility:** Never allow files from the vault to be committed to the public repository.
- **Foundational Synthesis:** Update vault files to maintain a "Living Foundation" of project intelligence.
- **NotebookLM Optimization:** Maintain `NOTEBOOK_LM_BUNDLE.md` as the source of truth for AI context.

## 3. Vault Components
- **`PROTOCOL_FOUNDATIONS.md`**: Biocybernetic principles and core identity.
- **`BUSINESS_STRATEGY.md`**: Market moats, monetization, and adoption roadmaps.
- **`TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`**: In-depth logic of CRE, ZK, and CCIP integrations.
- **`ROADMAP_EXPANSAO.md`**: [Strategy] Multi-phase expansion (Avalanche/Polygon).
- **`ASSET_CATALOG.md`**: [Assets] Index of high-fidelity visuals and core backups.

## 4. Operational Context
Use this skill to retrieve **Strategic Context** before initiating new development phases.
*   **Expansion Plan**: `cat ../greenproof-vault/ROADMAP_EXPANSAO.md`
*   **Visual Assets**: `cat ../greenproof-vault/ASSET_CATALOG.md`
