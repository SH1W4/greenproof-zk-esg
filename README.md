# 🌿 GREENPROOF: THE TRINITY OF PROOF
### **"Prove ESG ≥ 80% without revealing private data. Bridge it to any chain in 1 click."**

> *“GreenProof is the definitive protocol to eliminate greenwashing at the infrastructure level, transforming ESG compliance into a portable, private, and verifiable digital asset.”*

## 💡 The Challenge: The ESG "Oracle Problem"
The $2.1 Trillion Green Bond market is facing an integrity crisis. Current ESG reporting suffers from:
1. **Greenwashing:** Companies manipulate self-reported data to attract capital.
2. **Data Privacy Trap:** Detailed operational telemetry is too sensitive to share, yet essential for verification.
3. **Siloed Data:** ESG scores are static, non-portable, and disconnected from the blockchain economy.

## 🚀 The Solution: GreenProof
GreenProof is a decentralized orchestration protocol that solves the **ESG Oracle Problem** by combining **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK)** for extreme privacy and **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)** for total decentralization.

### 🌌 The Trinity of Proof (Triple Oracle Consensus)
To ensure absolute integrity, GreenProof ingests data from three independent dimensions of reality before any certification is issued:
1. **Physical Reality (IoT Sensors):** Real-time environmental signals (carbon, energy, water) captured via Chainlink Functions.
2. **Juridical Reality (Legal Audit):** Automated compliance check against global regulations via the **Th3m1s Juridical Protocol**.
3. **Ethical Reality (Ethical Logic):** Value-alignment and governance verification via the **SEVE Adaptive Ethical Framework**.

---

## 🛠 How it Works: The CRE Orchestrator
GreenProof uses **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)** as its execution backbone—not just as an oracle, but as a programmable orchestration layer that coordinates the entire lifecycle:

- **1. Ingestion & Consensus:** CRE triggers the "Trinity of Proof," requiring a 2/3 consensus between Physical, Legal, and Ethical oracles to prevent data manipulation.
- **2. ZK-Threshold Verification:** Once the score is calculated, a **ZK-SNARK** circuit (Circom) proves that `Score >= 80`. **We do not expose the exact score; we only prove it meets the standard.**
- **3. Cross-Chain Certification:** Upon a valid proof, CRE mints a **GreenProof NFT** (ERC-721) on Sepolia.
- **4. CCIP Global Bridge:** In a single, seamless action, CRE uses **Chainlink CCIP** to bridge the credential to Avalanche Fuji, ensuring RWA portability.

## 📊 Market Dominance: Why GreenProof Wins
Compared to legacy ESG reporting, GreenProof is:
- **Resilient:** 2/3 Oracle Consensus makes it "Greenwashing-Proof."
- **Private:** ZK-SNARKs enable industrial-grade privacy for RWA issuers.
- **Institutional:** Backed by an autonomous **Juridical Stress-Test**, ensuring legal defensibility for Green Bonds.

| Feature | Legacy ESG | GreenProof |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Model** | Centralized / Self-Reported | **Decentralized Triple Consensus** |
| **Data Privacy** | None or Total Secrecy | **Verifiable Privacy (ZK)** |
| **Automation** | Manual / Static | **Programmable Workflows (CRE)** |
| **Liquidity** | Illiquid Reports | **Portable RWA Credentials (CCIP)** |

## 🛡️ Structural Integrity & Juridical Seal
The GreenProof Protocol has undergone **Autonomous Juridical Structural Validation**. Our "Trinity of Proof" logic has been stress-tested to ensure compliance with global transparency standards, providing the missing link of confidence for institutional capital.

## ⚡ Quick Start & Verification
To verify the core protocol orchestration in seconds:
```bash
# 1. Start the project
npm install && npm run dev

# 2. Run the programmatic CRE workflow (Simulation)
cd cre && npx chainlink-cre run workflow.ts
```
