# 🌿 GREENPROOF: THE PROTOCOL OF TRUTH
### **"A Sovereign Integrity Protocol for RWAs, Orchestrated by Autonomous Agents."**

> *“GreenProof is the definitive settlement layer for objective reality—transforming ESG compliance from a static PDF into a portable, private, and intelligent digital protocol.”*

## 💡 The Challenge: The ESG "Oracle Problem"
The $2.1 Trillion Green Bond market is facing an integrity crisis. Current ESG reporting suffers from:
1. **Greenwashing:** Companies manipulate self-reported data to attract capital.
2. **Data Privacy Trap:** Detailed operational telemetry is too sensitive to share, yet essential for verification.
3. **Siloed Data:** ESG scores are static, non-portable, and disconnected from the blockchain economy.

## 🚀 The Solution: GreenProof
GreenProof is a decentralized orchestration protocol that solves the **ESG Oracle Problem** by combining **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK)** for extreme privacy and **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)** for total decentralization.

### 🌌 Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (HAAS)
The GreenProof Protocol is governed by an autonomous multi-agent hierarchy (HAAS), where specialized intelligences collaborate in a monolithic core using the **[EAP Synchronization Cycle](docs/EAP_CYCLE.md)**:
1. **GP-Physical (Physical Reality Core):** Real-time environmental signal ingestion.
2. **GP-Juridical (Juridical Logic Core):** Native legal validator and compliance engine.
3. **GP-Ethical (Ethical Value Core):** Global governance and value alignment guardian.

**[Explore the HAAS Orchestration Blueprint ➔](docs/HAAS_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

## 🛠 How it Works: The CRE Orchestrator
GreenProof uses **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)** as its execution backbone—not just as an oracle, but as a programmable orchestration layer that coordinates the entire lifecycle:

- **1. Ingestion & Consensus:** CRE triggers the "Trinity of Proof," requiring a 2/3 consensus between Physical, Legal, and Ethical oracles to prevent data manipulation.
- **2. ZK-Threshold Verification:** Once the score is calculated, a **ZK-SNARK** circuit (Circom) proves that `Score >= 80`. **We do not expose the exact score; we only prove it meets the standard.**
- **3. Cross-Chain Certification:** Upon a valid proof, CRE mints a **GreenProof NFT** (ERC-721) on Sepolia.
- **4. CCIP Global Bridge:** In a single, seamless action, CRE uses **Chainlink CCIP** to bridge the credential to Avalanche Fuji, ensuring RWA portability.

## 📊 Market Dominance: Why GreenProof Wins
Compared to legacy ESG reporting, GreenProof is:
- **Resilient:** 2/3 Oracle Consensus makes it "Greenwashing-Proof."
- **Private:** ZK-SNARKs enable industrial-grade privacy for RWA issuers.
- **Institutional:** Backed by an autonomous **Juridical Stress-Test**, ensuring legal defensibility for Green Bonds.

| Feature | Legacy ESG | GreenProof |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust Model** | Centralized / Self-Reported | **Decentralized Triple Consensus** |
| **Data Privacy** | None or Total Secrecy | **Verifiable Privacy (ZK)** |
| **Automation** | Manual / Static | **Programmable Workflows (CRE)** |
| **Liquidity** | Illiquid Reports | **Portable RWA Credentials (CCIP)** |

## 🌎 Beyond ESG: Institutional Expansion
The GreenProof **Sovereign MAS** is a universal settlement layer for objective truth. Our architecture is currently being adapted for:
- 📦 **Supply Chain**: Verifying RWA provenance and "Hard Evidence" telemetry.
- 🏦 **Private Credit**: ZK-Proofs for institutional creditworthiness without data leakage.
- ⚖️ **IP & Patents**: Verifying the structural integrity of intellectual property.

**[Explore the full Roadmap of Institutional Use Cases ➔](docs/USE_CASES.md)**

---

## 🛡️ Structural Integrity & Selective Disclosure
The GreenProof Protocol is governed by the **GreenProof Foundation** (a Symbeon Labs Initiative). To protect sovereign intellectual property while maintaining total transparency for evaluators, we operate under the **Sovereign Disclosure Protocol**. 

Our "Trinity of Proof" logic is based on a rigorous **[Mathematical & Algebraic Foundation](docs/MATHEMATICAL_FOUNDATION.md)**, ensuring legal and technical defensibility for institutional capital.

## ⚡ Quick Start & Verification
To verify the core protocol orchestration in seconds:
```bash
# 1. Start the project
npm install && npm run dev

# 2. Run the programmatic Sovereign Sync (Simulation)
# This script manages the gap between public code and private research
./scripts/sovereign-sync.sh --verify
```
